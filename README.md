# A cross-cohort analysis of dental plaque microbiome in early childhood caries

## Summary
Early childhood caries is a multifactorial disease with microbiome playing a significant role in caries progression. Understanding changes at the microbiome level in early childhood caries is required to develop diagnostic and preventive strategies. In our study, we combined data from small independent cohorts to compare microbiome composition and obtain a general picture of the ECC microbiome by combining the datasets. In order to effectively combine the datasets from different studies, we used a unified pipeline starting from raw data and applied batch correction to avoid the pitfalls of batch effects. Our meta-analysis identified common species between different studies. We identified the best ML method for the classification of ECC versus caries-free samples and compared the performance of this method using a leave-one-dataset-out approach. Our random forest model was found to be generalizable when used in combination with other studies. While our results highlight the potential microbial species involved in ECC and disease classification, we also mentioned the limitations that can serve as a guide for future researchers to design and use appropriate tools for such analyses.
